# Local Upload

## Usage

You can throw this into your `/var/www` or `/srv/http` folder. If you tell people your local IP they can upload files to your PC and download selected files from it easily.  
  
## Use-cases

This is for when your colleague is like "yeah let me just send you this 10GB Database dump" and uploading to Slack turns out to be bad for everyone.  
  
It also works wonders when you want to share files with non technical people and you don't want to bother with a USB drive, E-Mail, or Telegram / WhatsApp.

TLDR local transfer for large files or when other methods are unavailable.
